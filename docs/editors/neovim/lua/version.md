If you need access to the supported version of distant or the version of the
plugin itself, you can access this directly from the `version` field.

All versions follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

### CLI version

Today, the plugin exposes a minimum version requirement for the local distant
CLI used to communicate with servers and run/speak with the manager.
