To build distant from source, you will need to have
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and
[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) installed.

1. Clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.git`
2. From the root of the repository, build via `cargo build --release`
3. Copy the output binary from `target/release/distant` (or
   `target/release/distant.exe` on Windows)
